# Setup Complete! ðŸŽ‰

Your Docker development environment is now configured with automated release management and deployment using release-please and GitHub Actions.

## Files Created

### Release Management
- `release-please-config.json` - Configuration for release-please
- `.release-please-manifest.json` - Version tracking manifest
- `CHANGELOG.md` - Automated changelog generation

### GitHub Actions Workflows
- `.github/workflows/release-please.yml` - Main release and deployment workflow
- `.github/workflows/docker-build.yml` - PR testing and security scanning

### Documentation
- `RELEASE.md` - Comprehensive release and deployment guide
- `SETUP_COMPLETE.md` - This file with next steps

### DevContainer Configuration
- `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` - VSCode DevContainer configuration

### Updated Files
- `README.md` - Updated with Docker image usage instructions

## Next Steps

### 1. Push to GitHub

First, commit and push all the new files to your GitHub repository:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add automated release management and Docker deployment

- Add release-please configuration for automated releases
- Add GitHub Actions workflows for CI/CD
- Add comprehensive documentation
- Add DevContainer configuration for VSCode
- Update README with Docker image usage instructions"
git push origin main
```

### 2. Configure Repository Settings

1. **Enable GitHub Actions**: Go to your repository settings and ensure GitHub Actions are enabled.

2. **Set up GitHub Container Registry**: 
   - Go to your repository settings
   - Navigate to "Actions" â†’ "General"
   - Under "Workflow permissions", select "Read and write permissions"
   - Check "Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests"

3. **Package Visibility**: After the first release, go to your repository's "Packages" tab and ensure the Docker image visibility is set appropriately (public or private).

### 3. Create Your First Release

Since this is the initial setup, you'll need to trigger the first release:

1. **Wait for the workflow**: After pushing, GitHub Actions will run and create a Release PR.

2. **Review and merge**: A pull request titled "chore: release 0.1.0" (or similar) will be created automatically. Review and merge it.

3. **Automatic deployment**: Once merged, the Docker image will be built and pushed to `ghcr.io/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME:0.1.0`.

### 4. Update Repository References

Replace `YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME` in the following files with your actual GitHub username and repository name:

- `README.md`
- `RELEASE.md`
- `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`

### 5. Test the Setup

After the first release is created:

1. **Pull the image**:
   ```bash
   docker pull ghcr.io/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME:latest
   ```

2. **Test the container**:
   ```bash
   docker run -it --rm ghcr.io/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME:latest
   ```

3. **Test DevContainer**: Open the repository in VSCode and use "Reopen in Container" to test the DevContainer configuration.

## How to Make Future Releases

1. **Make changes** to your Docker environment (update Dockerfile, scripts, etc.)

2. **Commit with conventional commits**:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "feat: add new development tool"
   # or
   git commit -m "fix: resolve Python installation issue"
   ```

3. **Push to main**:
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```

4. **Review Release PR**: release-please will create a PR with the changelog and version bump.

5. **Merge Release PR**: This triggers the Docker image build and deployment.

## Available Docker Image Tags

After releases, your Docker images will be available at:

- `ghcr.io/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME:latest` - Latest release
- `ghcr.io/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME:v0.1.0` - Specific version
- `ghcr.io/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME:0.1` - Major.minor version
- `ghcr.io/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME:0` - Major version

## Usage Examples

### Docker Run
```bash
docker run -it --rm \
  -v $(pwd)/workspace:/home/developer/workspace \
  -p 3000:3000 -p 8000:8000 -p 8080:8080 \
  ghcr.io/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME:latest
```

### Docker Compose
```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  devenv:
    image: ghcr.io/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME:latest
    volumes:
      - ./workspace:/home/developer/workspace
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
      - "8000:8000"
      - "8080:8080"
```

### DevContainer
The `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` is ready to use with VSCode. Just open the repository in VSCode and select "Reopen in Container".

## Monitoring

- **GitHub Actions**: Monitor workflow runs in the "Actions" tab
- **Releases**: Check the "Releases" section for new versions
- **Packages**: View published Docker images in the "Packages" tab
- **Security**: Review Trivy security scan results in the "Security" tab

## Support

- Read `RELEASE.md` for detailed release process documentation
- Check GitHub Actions logs for troubleshooting
- Review conventional commit format for proper version bumping
- Ensure all Docker-related files are not in `.dockerignore`

Your development environment is now ready for automated releases and deployments! ðŸš€
